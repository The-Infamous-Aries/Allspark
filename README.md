await bot.user_data_manager.save_pet_data(user_id, username, pet_data)
await bot.user_data_manager.save_rpg_character(user_id, username, character_data)
await bot.user_data_manager.save_energon_stats(user_id, username, energon_stats)

# Access theme system data
theme_data = await bot.user_data_manager.get_theme_system_data(user_id, username)
```

**File Structure Example:**
```
